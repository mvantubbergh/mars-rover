## Mars Rover Challenge
This coding challenge entails simulating the movement of Mars Rovers on a plateau of given width and height. If the rover received instructions to move outside the borders of these given constraints, the rover simply ignores the command and moves onto the next. 


## Tests were written using JUnit 5. 
These tests can be found in the MarsRoverTest file. 


## Run the project using test inputs

Input - case sensitive:
```bash
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```

Output:

```bash
1 3 N
5 1 E
```
